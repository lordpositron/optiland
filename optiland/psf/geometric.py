class GeometricPSF(BasePSF):
    """Class representing the Geometric PSF.

    This class computes the PSF of an optical system by generating a 2D
    histogram of ray intersection points on the image plane (a spot diagram).
    It inherits common visualization and initialization functionalities from
    `BasePSF`.

    Args:
        optic (Optic): The optical system object.
        field (tuple): The field point (e.g., (Hx, Hy) in normalized field
            coordinates) at which to compute the PSF.
        wavelength (float): The wavelength of light in micrometers.
        num_rays (int, optional): The number of rays to trace for the spot
            diagram. Defaults to 1000.
        distribution (str, optional): The distribution of rays at the entrance
            pupil. Defaults to 'uniform'.
        bins (int, optional): The number of bins along each axis (x and y) for
            the 2D histogram that forms the PSF. Defaults to 128.
        normalize (bool, optional): Whether to normalize the PSF so that its
            values sum to 1. Defaults to True.

    Attributes:
        psf (be.ndarray): The computed Point Spread Function. This is a 2D
            array representing the intensity distribution in the image plane.
        x_edges (be.ndarray): The bin edges along the x-axis of the PSF.
        y_edges (be.ndarray): The bin edges along the y-axis of the PSF.
        spot_data (SpotDiagram): The underlying spot diagram data used to
            generate the PSF.
